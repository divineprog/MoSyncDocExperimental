The user interface is built in HTML and JavaScript, and the app uses the <a href="http://www.mosync.com/files/imports/doxygen/latest/html5/index.html">MoSync Wormhole JavaScript Library</a> to retrieve geolocation data from the device. The application is well commented throughout.</p><table class="doclayout" border="0"><tbody><tr><td>[img_assist|nid=8971|title=|desc=|link=none|align=none|width=210|height=315]</td><td>&nbsp;[img_assist|nid=8974|title=|desc=|link=none|align=none|width=210|height=315]</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><em>Main screen on Android</em></td><td><em>Main screen on iOS</em></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This application uses the MoSync <a href="http://www.mosync.com/files/imports/doxygen/latest/html5/geolocation.md.html#Geolocation"><span>Geolocation JavaScript API</span></a>, and should work on all platforms supported by this library (see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mosync.com/documentation/manualpages/featureplatform-matrix">Feature/Platform Support</a>).</p><p>This example is included in the MoSync SDK installation in the&nbsp;<em>/examples</em>&nbsp;folder.

To calculate the area of a square or rectangular block of land the user clicks at three corners in turn. At each corner, geolocation data is retrieved from the GPS sensor on the device.</p><p>The accuracy of the reading for a corner is displayed when it is retrieved: the user can improve the accuracy by clicking the button again.</p><p>When the GPS coordinates of the three corners have been recorded, the user can click the <strong>Calculate Area</strong> button to determine the area in square metres.</p><h2>In the code</h2><p><span>The application demonstrates the following important features of the MoSync API:</span></p><ul><li><span>The use of third-party JavaScript libraries in building platform-independent UIs.</span></li><li><span>The use of </span>the <a href="http://www.mosync.com/files/imports/doxygen/latest/html5/index.html">MoSync Wormhole JavaScript Library</a> to retrieve sensor data.</li><li>The use of callbacks for asynchronous operations.</li></ul><p>This application is the basis of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">comprehensive beginner's tutorial</span> designed to get you started with HTML5/JavaScript programming using the MoSync SDK.</p></body></html>
